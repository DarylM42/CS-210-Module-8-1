Portfolio submission

What did you do particularly well?
In my opinion I was able to follow the set forth industry practices in creating a code that functioned properly to the task set down.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I have no doubt there will be more techniques and coding strategies that I will learn as my journey continues. I think my code could have its efficiency and security improved. Especially since security was the focus implementing some type of security system that controls access based on the viewer would be helpful. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For resources and tools I used to overcome any challenges I faced I used the great tutoring center provided by SNHU as well as going back to past lessons to reread learned information and remember how formats as well as the coding related to what I was working on needed to be written. As far as what I found most challenging in this project it was making sure that all the different components were communicating with each other. Sometimes making an adjustment in one area breaks another so finding how to make sure they link properly and updating all the components that were effected by each change was a challenge for me.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The same thing I found the most challenging for me was what I think is very transferrable. It was one of the first times I was working with writting code that spanned across several components which meant a lot more moving parts and I had to really focus to make sure I was minimizing errors that could happen when compiling and debugging. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I just followed what I have learned and what was instructed in the lesson of the week as well as knowledge gained from weeks prior. Also using sense as a tool to test my code before bringing over to visual studios was very helpful to understand where issues were developing and it definitely helped reduce the amount of errors found when I really started coding it all together. I think its adaptable because the code is separated into several components that talk to each other this means not everything relies on one single line of code the weight is spread and more versatile for this reason.
